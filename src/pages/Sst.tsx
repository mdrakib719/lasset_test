              Dipto is an initiative under LaSSET, BSRM School of Engineering dedicated to designing and manufacturing affordable and accessible satellite training kits to enrich STEM culture and promote space education in Bangladesh. Our goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience by providing students, educators, and enthusiasts with practical tools to explore satellite technology.

Through Dipto, we aim to inspire the next generation of engineers, scientists and innovators, especially in underrepresented and underserved communities. By fostering curiosity and creativity, we believe Dipto can be a stepping stone toward a thriving space ecosystem in Bangladesh and beyond.

(Research on Aerial Vehicle with Enhanced Neural network)
</h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
            R.A.V.E.N is an innovative research project focused on integrating neural networks into drone flight control systems. The core objective is to develop intelligent algorithms that enable aerial vehicles to maintain flight stability in turbulent air conditions.

By combining machine learning with real-time sensor data, R.A.V.E.N aims to create drones that can adapt dynamically to unpredictable environmental challengesâ€”making autonomous flight safer, smarter, and more reliable.

This project has the potential to advance applications in disaster response, surveillance and remote sensing  especially in regions with complex weather patterns or uncertain flight paths.
