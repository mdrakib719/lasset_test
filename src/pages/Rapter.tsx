            RaptorX is an innovative unmanned aerial system (UAS) designed to elevate operational capability. Equipped with VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing) functionality, RaptorX effortlessly switches between vertical and horizontal flight modes, making it highly versatile for both confined environments and extended missions. Autonomous navigation systems enable it to independently plan routes, avoid obstacles, and adapt to real-time changes, reducing the need for continuous human supervision.
